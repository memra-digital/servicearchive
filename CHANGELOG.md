# 2.0.0

**NEW FEATURES:**

- Document categories with customizable colors which immensely help with categorizing everything
- A "general" tab in settings that now houses these settings:
    - Re-open tabs upon start
    - Auto-save interval
- Extended information for each document - you can add a lot of metadata to each document and then search for it!
- Splash screen which shows the latest documents and credits
- Context menus (or right-click menus, whatever you want to call them) are now all across the application

**CHANGED FEATURES:**

- Design refresh for the whole program - it's more consistent, compact and practical
- Improved editor - the word/char counters are faster and more useful and there are more formatting options
- Renaming and deleting doesn't have buttons in the sidebar anymore - instead, context menus are used for that now

**BUGS FIXED:**

- When resizing the window, layout would break
- The formatting buttons for the editor wouldn't accurately indicate the formatting for the selected text range

**TECHNICAL CHANGES:**

- The way documents are saved is completely different (previously everything would be saved in one JSON file, now only metadata is saved in a central JSON file and document content is saved in separate files). This might negatively impact performance a little bit for some operations (i.e. searching), but it definitely decreases the RAM usage and chance of data loss.
- Even though there are no new languages, the application is now much better for localization - it now supports various plurality rules (see [here](https://unicode-org.github.io/cldr-staging/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)). The string names are also now cleaned up and string values now support multiple placeholders.
